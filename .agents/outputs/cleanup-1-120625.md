**Files Changed**: 4 (agent outputs + completion report)
**Push Status**: PENDING

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `/bug <description>` creates issue with `bug` label | VERIFIED | File contains `--label bug` |
| `/feature <description>` creates issue with `enhancement` label | VERIFIED | File contains `--label enhancement` |
| Both use structured templates | VERIFIED | Templates include all required sections |
| Commands work with GitHub CLI | VERIFIED | Uses `gh issue create` |
| Templates include NPD sections | VERIFIED | Backend, frontend, database mentioned |

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report in `completion-docs/`
2. Verify GitHub issue #1 is closed
3. Use `/bug` or `/feature` commands as needed for future issues
