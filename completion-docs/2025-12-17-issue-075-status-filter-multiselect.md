# Task #75 - Status Filter Multi-select UX Enhancement - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary

Replaced the single-select status dropdown with a true multi-select component following the TagFilterCombobox pattern. Users can now see which statuses are selected directly in the trigger button without opening the dropdown.

**Key Metrics**:
- Files Created: 1
- Files Modified: 2
- Backend Tests: 458 passed
- E2E Tests: 22 passed (Chromium)
- Warnings Fixed: 0 (none found)
- Build Time: 5.63s

## What Was Accomplished

**Frontend**: 3 files
- Created `/home/pbrown/Novus-db/frontend/src/components/forms/StatusFilterMultiSelect.tsx` (148 lines)
- Modified `/home/pbrown/Novus-db/frontend/src/components/forms/SearchFilters.tsx`
- Modified `/home/pbrown/Novus-db/frontend/src/components/forms/ProjectSearchFilters.tsx`

**Backend**: 0 files (frontend-only change)

**Tests**: No new tests created (refactoring - existing E2E tests validate functionality)

### Component Features Implemented

1. **StatusFilterMultiSelect.tsx**
   - Popover-based UI following TagFilterCombobox pattern
   - Trigger displays: "Status" (none selected), status name (1 selected), "X selected" (2+)
   - Checkmark icons for selected items in dropdown
   - Full keyboard navigation: ArrowUp/Down, Enter to toggle, Escape to close
   - Mouse hover highlighting
   - Static list of 5 status options (no search needed)

2. **SearchFilters.tsx / ProjectSearchFilters.tsx**
   - Removed Select component imports
   - Removed `handleStatusChange` function (logic moved inline)
   - Integrated StatusFilterMultiSelect with existing props
   - Preserved badge removal and "Include cancelled" checkbox functionality

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- TypeScript: PASS (0 errors)
- ESLint: PASS (0 warnings)
- Black (Python): PASS
- Ruff (Python): PASS
- Production Build: PASS (5.63s)

### Test Execution
- Backend Tests Run: 458
- Backend Tests Passed: 458
- Backend Test Duration: 14.12s
- E2E Tests Run: 22 (Chromium)
- E2E Tests Passed: 22
- E2E Test Duration: 5.2s

### E2E Testing Notes
- Firefox/WebKit browsers not installed (pre-existing infrastructure issue)
- All Chromium E2E tests pass including authenticated navigation
- Test container was rebuilt to pick up new component

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - implementation was clean.

### Warnings Fixed
None required - zero warnings found in both frontend and backend.

## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items**: 0
- No future work or Phase 2 items mentioned in issue #75

## Known Limitations & Future Work
- Firefox/WebKit E2E browsers not installed (tracked separately, not related to this issue)
- Visual verification should be performed by user to confirm UX improvements meet expectations

## Workflow Performance
| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-flight | 1m | <2m |
| Build Verification | 0m (already done by Build agent) | - |
| Test Execution | 19s | <15m |
| E2E Testing | 5s | <5m |
| Issue Fixes | 0m | - |
| Cleanup | 3m | <10m |
| **Total** | **~5m** | <45m |

## Scope Accuracy Analysis
**Plan Listed Files**: 3 (1 created, 2 modified)
**Build Actually Modified**: 3
**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. Build agent followed the TagFilterCombobox pattern correctly
2. No lint or type errors introduced
3. Clean separation of concerns - component is reusable

### What Could Be Improved
1. Test container was not automatically rebuilt after frontend changes, causing initial E2E failures
2. Could add unit tests for StatusFilterMultiSelect component specifically

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
Not applicable - this was a UX enhancement, not a bug fix.

### Process Improvements Identified
- [ ] Consider auto-rebuilding test containers when frontend code changes
- [ ] Document browser installation for E2E testing in development setup
